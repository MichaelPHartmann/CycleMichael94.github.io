<t>
FinMesh is a python-based package that brings together financial data from various
sources in one place for ease of use and distribution. The four main sections of
FinMesh are:
(1) the <a href='https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/'>IEX REST API</a>,
(2) data from the <a href='https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/digitalstrategy/pages/developer.aspx'>US treasury</a>,
(3) the data from the <a href='https://fred.stlouisfed.org/'>US Federal Reserve Economic Data</a>,
(4) and data from the SEC's <a href='https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html'>EDGAR</a> system.
<br>
<br>
The purpose of this package and its sub-packages was originally to practice interacting
with API data. With third-party API packages there is always the risk of outages or bugs.
In building the original IEX wrapper we sought to build something easy to understand and use,
that can be updated quickly and accurately.
<br>
<br>
With the addition of the US Federal data the opportunity arose to create a package that
could deliver all sorts of economic and security data from one place. In doing so we
hope to create a low-barrier way for beginners to play with large and very useful data sets.
In the future, this package will be updated with new financial and economic APIs.
<br>
<br>
If you know of a low or no cost API that could be incorporated
please raise it as an issue and we will work to have it done ASAP.

<div class='parasection'>
<mainheading>Installation</mainheading>
<div id='divline'></div>
<t>
FinMesh is available publicly from <a href='https://pypi.org/project/FinMesh/'><u>PYPI</u></a>
and can be installed and updated through a command line pip. Because the package is still growing
and changing be sure to update often or check the <a href='https://pypi.org/project/FinMesh/'>PYPI</a> page for possible updates.
<br>
<br>
There are several dependencies used in FinMesh, that soid, most of the package is built
to be as stand-alone as possible. Most of the dependencies used are fairly standard, and you will be
prompted to install when neccesary.
<br>
<br>
Some APIs require authentication through the use of tokens. These tokens should be
set up as environment variables in the bash profile.
I wrote a simple article outlining the setup on Mac and Linux which you can read through <a href='token_setup.html'><u>HERE.</u></a>

</t>
</div>


<div class='parasection'>
<mainheading>IEX Functionality</mainheading>
<div id='divline'></div>
<t>
IEX offers a vast array of financial and economic data. The REST API brings in data from many third party
vendors as well as primary exchange data from IEX itself. Available data ranges from sentiment to Forex, and
commodities to standardized financial statements. If you are looking to gather data for simple or algorithmic
analysis, this is the best place to start.
<br>
<br>
An account is required to access the IEX API and most endpoints are only available to paid accounts.
That said the lowest paid tier offers more than enough access for most individuals.
In FinMesh, there are two main tokens that are used, a main key and a sandbox key.
<br>
<br>
Further, if you wish to make use of IEX's sandbox mode, you will need to create a boolean variable called SANDBOX and set it to True.
A built-in parser will determine which token to use and make the adjustments for you.
<br>
<br>
The tokens should be stored in the following way as environment variables:
<br>
<br>
IEX_TOKEN=YOURTOKENHERE
<br>
and
<br>
IEX_SANDBOX_TOKEN=YOURSANDBOXTOKENHERE
<br>
<br>

<div class='parasection'>
<mainheading>FRED Functionality</mainheading>
<div id='divline'></div>
<t>
The Federal Reserve of Economic Data (also know as FRED) maintains all the national economic data such
as housing starts, non-farm payroll, and GDP. The available data is the broad and it is recommended you use
the website to find the information you are looking for and then query the API through FinMesh. You are able to list
available data through FinMesh.
<br>

</t>
</div>


<div class='parasection'>
<mainheading>EDGAR Functionality</mainheading>
<div id='divline'></div>
<t>
The EDGAR system is the Security and Exchange Commission's database of all corporate filings including
10-Ks, change in ownership statements, and acquisition disclosures. The website is quite user friendly
while programatic data colllection adds several layers of complexity. In it's current iteration, FinMesh
is able to automatically find document types through plain text query and return any number of raw text, html,
xbrli, and in some cases, xlsx filing information.
<br>
<br>
In the future the goal is to have complete, sanitized, and standardized information available for download in a csv or xlsx
format for any document and every stock.

<div class='parasection'>
<mainheading>Compatibility with APIs</mainheading>
<div id='divline'></div>
<t>
The name of the function shall be the name of the endpoint.
The function shall accept all variables for a given endpoint using the same variable
names per the documentation.
<br>
<br>
Differences between API documentation and this package should be considered errors.
Please raise an issue if you notice discrepancies.
<br>
<br>
Specific documentation for every FinMesh function is not available but a list <a href='new_function_list.html'><u>HERE</u></a> can show you
what options there are and the IEX docs will give you a full run down of the parameters.
In general, to set a parameter you can set the parameter name equal to the desired output.
