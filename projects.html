<h2><a href='https://github.com/MichaelPHartmann/FinMesh'><mainheading>FinMesh</mainheading></a></h2>
<div id="divline"></div>
<h3><heading>A Python API wrapper for various financial APIs.</heading></h3>
<br>
<br>
<t>
FinMesh is a python-based package that brings together financial data from various sources in one place for ease of use and distribution.
The four main sections of FinMesh are
(1) the IEX REST API,
(2) data from the US treasury,
(3) data from the US Federal Reserve Economic Data, and
(4) data from the SECs EDGAR system.
<br>
<br>
I have written all about this project in multiple locations, so I'll spare the details here.
<br>
<br>
If you can read all about FinMesh by clicking the title above, or by clicking the link in the navigation bar which will bring you to the ReadTheDocs page for FinMesh.
<br>
<br>
You can `pip install FinMesh` if you want to try it out for yourself.

<h2><a href='https://github.com/MichaelPHartmann/Visual-Finance'><mainheading>Visual Finance</mainheading></a></h2>
<div id="divline"></div>
<h3><heading>A visual application for using IEX Cloud without code.</heading></h3>
<br>
<br>
<t>
This is a web-app for accessing and assessing data from IEX Cloud. It can be difficult to find quality financial data online for personal use.
This application will allow you to create portfolios and watchlists.
Most importantly it will be a portal to download data in a customozable format for use in Excel and other places.
IEX Cloud is relatively inexpensive compared to other sources such as Morningstar, so this could be extremely useful for students and hobbyists.
<br>
<br>
The back-end is built on an SQLite database, with a custom Python query builder and interface.
There is also a JavaScript API that the front end will use directly.
The front end will be built in Django, with full support for profiles and downloads.

<h2><a href='https://github.com/MichaelPHartmann/website_element_painter'><mainheading>Website Element Painter</mainheading></a></h2>
<div id="divline"></div>
<h3><heading>A small Python add-on for people that manage their own HTML-based websites.</heading></h3>
<br>
<br>
<t>
I was tired of making sure all my head, header, and footer elements matched across web pages.
When I started searching for solutions I found plenty of people that had come up on this issue but not many that offered a satisfactory solution.
Turns out that with vanilla HTML and CSS, what I was looking for was impossible.
<br>
<br>
There are options - yes. You have PHP, but that is server side and with my website being hosted on GitHub for now, that's not an option.
Javascript and html_include is probably the best option out there for this, and it is probably better than this solution.
That said, Javascript adds weight and reliability issues that I'm not sure I want to deal with.
<br>
<br>
So I wrote this little script to automate the update of headers, footers, and heads.
It is dead simple, and relies on a human marking each of their pages with HTML comments.
The thing is, it's simple to understand, all the processing is done locally with the developer (me), so mistakes are caught immediately and before they are published, and all my webpages remain plain HTML and CSS for maximum speed.

<h2><a href='https://github.com/MichaelPHartmann/egdar_filings_scraper'><mainheading>EDGAR Filings Scraper</mainheading></a></h2>
<h3><div id="divline"></div>
<heading>A Node.js scraper for the SEC EDGAR database.</heading></h3>
<br>
<br>
<t>
I originally created a website scraper as part of an Ania Kubow tutorial, and was wanting to customize and extend the functionality a bit.
I didn't find many examples on services like Rapid API so I figured I would give it a go.
I had already worked with the EDGAR system extensively in Python so I was familiar with it.
<br>
<br>
This API supports gathering (1) the most recent filings for all US-based companies,
(2) the most recent filings for a particular filing organization, and
(3) the most recent filings of a certain type for a particular filing organization.

<h2><a href='https://github.com/MichaelPHartmann/Recipe_Builder'><mainheading>Recipe Building, Filing, Editing, and Displaying</mainheading></a></h2>
<div id="divline"></div>
<h3><heading>A Python-based project for managing recipes.</heading></h3>
<br>
<br>
<t>
Every time I try to make a plan for the week's meals I alwasy seem to spend a lot of time Googling
Most of the time I'm Googling recipes that I've made a couple times, but forget what ingredients I need.
It takes time, is annoying, and most of all, its unreliable, as there have been times where I can;t find the recipe I used previously.
<br>
<br>
This is a project to help with that.
Originally I wanted to just make a recipe randomizer, where I can store recipe URLs and then select them at random.
What this turned into was a way to build, edit, and store recipes in a standard JSON format.
This is still a work in progress.
<br>
<br>
Turns out that the day after I put this on my website, a similar recipe search engine popped up.
It scrapes, but does not reformat recipes to be uniform and saving favourites looks like it is not a feature.
My project may be put on the back burner then!
That project is <a href='https://stovetop.app/'>HERE:</a>
<br>
<br>
<subheading> What's Done:</subheading>
<li>Adding new recipes with sections for ingredients, instructions, and notes</li>
<li>Editing recipes already in the database</li>
<li>GET requests to a localhost with endpoints for displaying a list of recipes or a single recipe</li>
<br>
<subheading>What's Next:</subheading>
<li>Viewing recipes in the command line or on a local-hosted website</li>
<li>Automated scraping of recipe websites to streamline recipe addition</li>
<li>Cloud storage for recipe database</li>
<li>An app to manage recipes from</li>

<h2><a href='https://github.com/MichaelPHartmann/MichaelPHartmann.github.io'><mainheading>This Website</mainheading></a><h2>
<div id="divline"></div>
<h3><heading>An HTML and CSS based website to house my resume and links to personal projects.</heading></h3>
<br>
<br>
<t>
GitHub wesbites are so simple and easy to set-up so when I wanted to make a custom site and didn't want to spend money it was the only option.
<br>
This website has taught me a lot about html and css, and even more about how to manage a project that I only come back to a couple times a year.
<br>
It's not fancy but it gets the job done.
