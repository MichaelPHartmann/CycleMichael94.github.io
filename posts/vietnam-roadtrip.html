				<h2>My Motorcycle Trip from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City</h2>
				<h3>Day One (Thursday) - Hanoi to Ninh Binh</h3>
				The first day was a relatively short ride from Hanoi to Ninh Binh.
				It took me about two hours in total and brought me down closer to the coast.
				The trip was mostly main roads through the outskirts of Hanoi but the last part was a scenic ride through rice paddies.
				I dropped off my bags at the hostel dorm bed before going to find some dinner.
				My hostel was in the middle of farm land so I ventured about twenty minutes away to where Google said a bunch of restaurants were.
				I was surprised by amazing rock formations that rose out of the rice paddies.
				The road weaved through them offering unforgettable views.
				The flat, water filled rice paddies combined with the rocky monoliths were the highlight of that night.
				Once I got back to the hostel I took a dip in the ice cold pool, had a cold beer and signed out of work for the next week.
				<h3>Day Two (Friday) - Ninh Binh to Thanh Chuong Tea Islands</h3>
				On the second day I rode from Ninh Binh to the Tea Islands.
				This would take me about five hours through gentle mountain roads and small villages.
				This whole trip is taking place during the tourism low season and at the tail end of Tet (Vietnamese Lunar New Year) so towns were quite quiet.
				I arrived at my accomodation which was a stilted cabin on the hillsid overlooking a lake surrounded by tea fields.
				There I met a Dutch guy who was going in the same direction.
				We had dinner at th lodg along with a Vietnamese family who was enthusiasic about us joining in on their celebrations.
				We joined them for some rice wine and tried a drink that was based on rice wine but had many other spices in it.
				Oddly it tasted kind of chocolatey and we were not sure exactly why or what we were having.
				It was drank out of a large earthen pot with long bamboo straws.
				<h3>Day Three (Saturday) - Tea Islands to Phong Na Ke Bang</h3>
				The third day my new Dutch firend and I rode about four hours from the Tea Islands to Phong Na Ke Bang National Park.
				This was the first day of riding where I saw some real twisty roads.
				My friend was on a semi-automatic and had not ridden much so I blasted my way through the flowing turns and slowed down on the straights so he could catch up.
				My bike was a Honda CB150 that I strapped my duffle bag and backpack to.
				It topped out at about 100 KM/H although the cruising speed was about 70 KM/H.
				I think on average I moved about 50 KM/H for most of the trip with stops and slow traffic through towns.
				Phong Na is a little town situated in a deep valley along a large river.
				It's famous for it's caves which I did not get to see due to time and an incredibly high cost for the tour.
				I randomly ran into the Dutch friend while out for dinner.
				I tried to call it an early night because I knew the next day was going to be long, but the Vietnamese love for Karoake interfered a bit with that.
				<h3>Day Four (Sunday) - Phong Na Ke Bang to Khe San</h3>
				This day took my from Phong Na to Khe San along the Ho Chi Minh trail.
				This is one of the most scenic and isolated roads in Vietnam as it winds through mountains along the Laotian border.
				It helps that part way through the road is washed out and the trail is only wide enough the accomodate a bike or scooter.
				I went as long as forty five minutes between seing anyone else on the road.
				In total it was alittle over five and a half hours.
				I made two stops, one at a river to splash some cold water on my face and apply sunscreen (it was about 35C) and one for lunch where I met a group of travellers from Canada, England, and the US.
				I've realised that the best way to find lunch is to look for the tell tale scooters and bikes with backpacks strapped to the back.
				Th views on this day were unreal and the road was perfect, I would have happily ridden it a couple more times.
				I ended the day at a little hotel that did not have hot water.
				<h3>Day Five (Monday) - Khe San to Hue</h3>
				This day I started by getting an oil change in Khe San.
				The rental company requires oil changes every thousand kilometers which I thought was low until I realized these bikes have no oil filter so the oil must be changed more often.
				In all it took abou 10 minutes and cost about $5 CAD.
				This was a pretty short day at only around 3 hours.
				I came down from he mountains and back towards the coast.
				The ride was unremarkable except for a car hitting a cow pie and covering me head to toe in crap.
				My body prevented my luggage from getting hit but my pants, shirt, and bike were all covered.
				I pulled over at the first hose I saw and it happened to be a high pressure washer used for the department of highways.
				I changed shirts and blasted my arms and legs before getting my bike mostly clean again.
				My pants dried quite quickly but the shirt was a write off. I threw it out before continuing on my way.
				<h3>Day Six (Tuesday) - Hue to Hoi An</h3>
				<h3>Day Seven (Wednesday) - Rest Day in Hoi An</h3>
				<h3>Day Eight (Thursday) - Hoi An to Kon Tum</h3>
				<h3>Day Nine (Friday) - Kon Tum to Buon Ma Thout</h3>
				<h3>Day Ten (Saturday) - Buon Ma Thout to Da Lat</h3>
				<h3>Day Eleven (Sunday) - Rest Day in Da Lat</h3>
				<h3>Day Twelve (Monday) - Da Lat to Ho Chi Minh City</h3>
