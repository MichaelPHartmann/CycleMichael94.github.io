<mainheading>About</mainheading>
<div id="divline"></div>
<t>I am a B.B.A. graduate with a specialization in finance and experience in investing through my involvement with the TWU Student Managed Investment Fund (SMIF) as a Portfolio Manager. Currently I am preparing to write my first CFA exam in February 2021. I am looking for employment opportunities in the areas of finance, equity research, and operations.
<br>
<br>
I am a hard working and ambitious employee who invests personally in any organization
in which I am placed. I am a natural leader who knows how to create task flows and delegate,
and also knows how to work in a team environment.
<br>
<br>
In addition to my strong skills in Excel, Word, and Powerpoint I have cultivated
a proficiency in programming - specifically in Python - that I use to perform
financial analysis and DCF modelling. In my role as Portfolio Manager with SMIF
I led valuation workshops and walked new hires through the process of pitching a stock -
from screening stocks to building a superb pitch deck.
<br>
<br>
With Python, I co-wrote a wrapper that interacts with the IEX, FRED, and EDGAR APIs
to streamline data aggregation and lower barriers to accessing that data. It is an
ongoing project that adds functionality continually. The project is called FinMesh
and is available from PyPi and GitHub. I also have some experience writing in HTML,
and CSS which I used to create this website from scratch. In the future I am looking
to learn C, JavaScript, and SQL.
<br>
<br>
Beyond finance, I am passionate about specialty coffee and film photography. While these
passions rarely merge with the world of finance I am always looking for intersections between
the two. The time, attention and science behind a carefully-made cup of coffee
and the deliberateness of film photography are what draw me to these topics. In the same way,
attention to detail and curation of financial services and skills to clients is what propels me in
that field.

<div id="divline"></div>
<heading>Microsoft Office Suite</heading>
<br>
<t>I have extensive hands on use of all the main components of the Microsoft Office suite,

<br>
<br>
<heading>Financial Analysis and Modelling</heading>
<br>
<t>Through courses and personal interest work, I have honed my analysis and modelling skills.

valuations of companies using both DCF and DDM models. I am proficient in using statistal analysis and
street insight in developing forecasts.</t>
<br>
<br>
<heading>Python & Programming</heading>
<br>
<t>I have spent the last 8 months casually learning how to write various programs in Python, utilizing
JSON, XML, and excel data to power financial modelling and analysis. I developed (and continue to build) a PYPI
package that makes accessing financial APIs easier. It can be found <a href='https://pypi.org/project/FinMesh/'>HERE</a>.</t>
<br>
<br>
<heading>Merchandising</heading>
<br>
<t>This skill is about more just putting product on shelves, but understanding how products need to be displayed to
sell well. Merchandising is about creating connections between the customer and the product.</t>

<heading>TWU SMIF // Portfolio Manager</heading>
<br>
<subheading>September 2017 to April 2019</subheading>
<br>
<t>This student-led investment fund had just finished it's inaugural year with dozens of
stocks pitched and several selected for investment. Seminars, training, and stock selection
meetings are run throughout the semester and each analyst is able to vote for which stocks
they think should be invested in.
<br>
Significant accomplishments while working with the fund include raising approximately $200,000 in capital and securing a trusted broker, as well as leading investments into appropraite value stocks. Due to the fledgling nature of the fund, opportunities to write major fund-defining documents arose, and I took on writng the official Fund Guidelines and Policy Document which included meeting guidelines, asset allocations, hiring practices, and various other protocols.
