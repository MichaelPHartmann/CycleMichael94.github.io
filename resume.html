<mainheading>About</mainheading>
<div id="divline"></div>
<t>I am a B.B.A. graduate with a specialization in finance and experience in investing through my involvement with the TWU Student Managed Investment Fund (SMIF) as a Portfolio Manager. Currently I am preparing to write my first CFA exam in February 2021. I am looking for employment opportunities in the areas of finance, equity research, and operations.
<br>
<br>
I am a hard working and ambitious employee who invests personally in any organization
in which I am placed. I am a natural leader who knows how to create task flows and delegate,
and also knows how to work in a team environment.
<br>
<br>
In addition to my strong skills in Excel, Word, and Powerpoint I have cultivated
a proficiency in programming - specifically in Python - that I use to perform
financial analysis and DCF modelling. In my role as Portfolio Manager with SMIF
I led valuation workshops and walked new hires through the process of pitching a stock -
from screening stocks to building a superb pitch deck.
<br>
<br>
With Python, I co-wrote a wrapper that interacts with the IEX, FRED, and EDGAR APIs
to streamline data aggregation and lower barriers to accessing that data. It is an
ongoing project that adds functionality continually. The project is called FinMesh
and is available from PyPi and GitHub. I also have some experience writing in HTML,
and CSS which I used to create this website from scratch.
<br>
<br>
Beyond finance, I am passionate about specialty coffee and film photography. While these
passions rarely merge with the world of finance I am always looking for intersections between
the two. The time, attention and science behind a carefully-made cup of coffee
and the deliberateness of film photography are what draw me to these topics. In the same way,
attention to detail and curation of financial services and skills to clients is what propels me in
that field.

<heading>Financial Analysis and Modelling</heading>
<br>
<t>While I was a Portfolio Manager with TWU SMIF, I spent most of my time completing valuations (somewhere around 175 in my two-year tenure) and building pitch decks and two-page summaries for those valuations.
I also was involved in training a group of analysts in stock selection, research, valuation, and pitching.
As the fund outgrew the somewhat simple valuation spreadsheet I took the lead in re-imagining our process and created a new valuation template for the fund to use.
Through courses and personal interest work, I have honed my analysis and modelling skills.
I know how to read 10-K's and extract meaningful information from them, and use that to develop
valuations of companies using both DCF and DDM models. I am proficient in using statistal analysis and
street insight in developing forecasts.</t>
<br>
<br>
<heading>Programming</heading>
<br>
<t>I have significant experience using <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> to create a custom website from scratch.
Working on my personal project <a href='https://pypi.org/project/FinMesh/'><b>FinMesh</b></a> has taught me <b>Python</b>, specifically extracting, structuring, and analyzing data from <b>JSON</b>, sometimes using <b>Pandas</b>.
I also have proficiency in <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>SQL</b>, and some knowledge of <b>BASH</b> scripting as well.
I am familiar with <b>XML</b>, <b>MarkDown</b>, and <b>rST</b>.
I have many years of experience using Git to manage projects from the command line.</t>
<br>
<br>
<heading>Formal Writing and Communication</heading>
<br>
<t>I am a fluent English communicator with experience in formal writing.
I authored TWU SMIFâ€™s Investment Guidelines and Fund Procedures document that laid out things like job descriptions and asset allocation goals as well as auxiliary documents regarding hiring, best practices, and organizational charts.
I have also spent a considerable amount of time writing documentation, guides, and tutorials for FinMesh which are available to the public online.
In my role as pick-up framer supervisor, I have had to liaise with coworkers to determine how we can assist each other in increasing productivity, with other trades to determine needed changes to the plans and order of operations for specific details, and with site supervisors to make sure that our safety, cleanliness, and output is up to their standard.</t>
<br>
<br>
<heading>Microsoft Office Suite</heading>
<br>
<t>I have extensive hands on use of all the main components of the Microsoft Office suite,
and have used each to write proposals and memos, build financial models, solve statistical problems,
and present findings of research.</t>
<br>
<br>
<heading>Merchandising</heading>
<br>
<t>This skill is about more just putting product on shelves, but understanding how products need to be displayed to
sell well. Merchandising is about creating connections between the customer and the product.</t>

<div id="divline"></div>
<heading>TWU SMIF // Portfolio Manager</heading>
<br>
<subheading>September 2017 to April 2019</subheading>
<br>
<t>This student-led investment fund had just finished it's inaugural year with dozens of
stocks pitched and several selected for investment. Seminars, training, and stock selection
meetings are run throughout the semester and each analyst is able to vote for which stocks
they think should be invested in.
<br>
Significant accomplishments while working with the fund include raising approximately $200,000 in capital and securing a trusted broker, as well as leading investments into appropriate value stocks.
Due to the fledgling nature of the fund, opportunities to write major fund-defining documents arose, and I took on writing the official Fund Guidelines and Policy Document which included meeting guidelines, asset allocations, hiring practices, and various other protocols.
