<mainheading>About</mainheading>
<div id="divline"></div>
<t>
They say a jack-of-all-trades but master of none is still better than a master of one.
As you may see from my experiences in customer service, retail, construction, finance, and tech I certainly fall into the JOAT category.
<br>
<br>
I graduated with a B.B.A. in corporate finance, interested in putting my skills to use performing research and analyses on investments.
When I turned to the job market I found banking careers to be sparse in Vancouver, and the connections and credentials required to land them lacking on my end.
I turned to my previous summer job in construction where I was invigorated by working with my hands and managing the process of building a house from nothing but a stack of wood.
Framing houses is a job I thoroughly enjoyed (although the weather some days tried to solve that) and it is still something I miss doing.
<br>
<br>
I had been interested in tech and programming since around 2018 when I entered a programming competition called Battlesnake.
Competing head-to-head in the classic game of Snake, I coded and 'AI' serpeant and was promptly knocked out in the first round.
Through the subsequent years I worked mainly on a pet-project called FinMesh which helped hone my Python and data management skills.
<br>
<br>
In the summer of 2021 my wife accepted a teaching position in Cairo, Egypt and I was given the incredible opportunity to step back from a job and focus on upgrading my technical skills.
The hope was that in a few months I could land an entry-level remote position in tech and leverage that to move into development roles.
Through Codeacademy I took several courses in Python, SQL, JavaScript and web design and felt decently equiped to take on a new role.
We both figured that with so many companies going 'remote' in the wake of Covid-19, it would simple to find a job.
<br>
<br>
I submitted hundreds of job applications across all sorts of companies, but it seemed that when companies say 'remote' they actually just mean 'you need to live in the same city as our office but you can work at home'.
Not exactly ideal when I live in Egypt.
Finally in January of 2022 I accepted a job as a Support Engineer at MonetizeMore and the timing could not have been better.
I was less than a week away from booking flights home to go back to work in construction.
<br>
<br>
That is where I am now, learning and gaining experience in a great remote company that allows me to pursue a career I genuinely love.

<t>
I spend most of my time as a Solutions Engineer giving feedback on, debugging, and implementing ad-related code for digital content publishers across multiple geographies and platforms.
This work heavily includes reading and debugging <b>Javascript</b>, <b>PHP</b>, <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and frameworks like <b>React</b>.
<br>
My main personal project <a href="https://finmesh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><b>FinMesh</b></a> is a <b>Python</b> wrapper for multiple financial information APIs and sources.
At the base layer it makes financial data easier to access and at a higher level allows you to save, load, and export data with <b>Pandas</b>.
<br>
I am also familiar with working from the <b>command-line</b> writing simple <b>BaSh</b> scripts for every day tasks.
I do all my personal and professional work from <b>Linux</b> and am familiar with it's conventions and work flow.
Through Codeacademy I have also taken courses in <b>SQL</b> and using that technology for data analysis.
<br>
At my current job I use a combination of <b>Jira</b>, <b>Pivotal</b>, and <b>BitBucket</b> to manage issues and our team's agile environment.
For my personal projects and website I manage everything from <b>GitHub</b>.
I am more than comfortable managing all my workflow with <b>Git</b>.

<h3><heading>Data Analysis and Financial Modelling<heading></h3>
<br>
<t>
While I was a Portfolio Manager with TWU SMIF, I spent most of my time completing valuations (somewhere around 175 in my two-year tenure) and building pitch decks and two-page summaries for those valuations.
I also was involved in training a group of analysts in stock selection, research, valuation, and pitching.
As the fund outgrew the somewhat simple valuation spreadsheet I took the lead in re-imagining our process and created a new valuation template for the fund to use.
Through courses and personal interest work, I have honed my analysis and modelling skills.
I am proficient in using statistal analysis and street insight in developing forecasts.
<br>
<br>
<h3><heading>Formal Writing and Communication<heading></h3>
<br>
<t>
I am a fluent English communicator with experience in formal writing.
I authored TWU SMIFâ€™s Investment Guidelines and Fund Procedures document that laid out things like job descriptions and asset allocation goals as well as auxiliary documents regarding hiring, best practices, and organizational charts.
I have also spent a considerable amount of time writing documentation, guides, and tutorials for FinMesh which are available to the public online.
In my role as pick-up framer supervisor, I have had to liaise with coworkers to determine how we can assist each other in increasing productivity, with other trades to determine needed changes to the plans and order of operations for specific details, and with site supervisors to make sure that our safety, cleanliness, and output is up to their standard.

Significant accomplishments while working with the fund include raising approximately $200,000 in capital and securing a trusted broker, as well as leading investments into appropriate value stocks.
Due to the fledgling nature of the fund, opportunities to write major fund-defining documents arose, and I took on writing the official Fund Guidelines and Policy Document which included meeting guidelines, asset allocations, hiring practices, and various other protocols.
